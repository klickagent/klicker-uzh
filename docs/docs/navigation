When you log into your Klicker UZH Account, you directly reach the question pool. On the top left corner - next to the word "Question Pool" - you find the Menu symbol (1.). Clicking on it, the navigation menu opens. Via this menu you reach the session list (all running, planned and past sessions) and you can directly jump into your currently running session.
